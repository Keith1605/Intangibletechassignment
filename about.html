<p>Overcooked is a chaotic couch co-op cooking game for one to four players. Working as a team, you and your fellow chefs must prepare, cook and serve up a variety of tasty orders before the baying customers storm out in a huff. Sharpen your knives and dust off your chef‚Äôs whites, there isn‚Äôt mushroom for error and the steaks are high in these crazy kitchens!</p>
<br>
<p>The Onion Kingdom is in danger and only the finest cooking can save it! In Overcooked players must journey through a variety of cruel and unusual kitchens on their quest to become master chefs capable of conquering an ancient edible evil which plagues the land.</p>
<br>
<p>Play solo or engage in classic, chaotic couch co-op for up to four players in both co-operative and competitive challenge modes. You‚Äôll have to cook a range of different dishes and work together in order to become the most effective and ultimate team!</p>

<h2>SIMPLE CONTROLS/DEEP CHALLENGE</h2>
	<p>Overcooked is so easy to pick up that anyone can join in the fun, but finding a team who can communicate and co-ordinate their actions when the pizza hits the fan, that's when only a well-oiled team of super-chefs will come out on top!</p>
<h2>DIFFERENT WAYS TO PLAY</h2>
<p>Whether indulging in deep fried local co-op or saut√©ed single player, as you play through the game you'll unlock new levels, new chef characters and even competitive challenge levels which allow teams of two to engage in hard boiled head-to-head in the kitchen.<br>

However you want to play, if you think you can stand the heat, then get ready to enter the kitchen! </p>
